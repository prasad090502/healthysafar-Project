        <p>
          At <strong>HealthySafar</strong>, we prepare salads, juices and other food items fresh for every order.
          Due to the perishable nature of our products and strict hygiene standards, our refund policy is carefully
          designed to maintain safety and fairness.
        </p>

        <hr class="my-4">

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">1. Scope</h2>
        <p>This Refund Policy applies to payments made for:</p>

          <li>Food Orders (salads, juices, fruit boxes and other perishable products);</li>
          <li>Subscriptions / Memberships and wellness plans;</li>
          <li>Non-food products / services (if offered by HealthySafar).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">2. Strict No-Refund for Food Orders</h2>
        <p>
          Once a food order is placed and payment is successfully processed, it is
          <strong>non-cancellable, non-refundable and non-returnable</strong>, except in limited cases mentioned below.
        </p>
        <p>Refunds will NOT be provided for reasons including (but not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Change of mind after placing the order;</li>
          <li>Wrong item/variant/quantity selected by you;</li>
          <li>Taste, flavour or personal preference;</li>
          <li>Perceived portion size or presentation;</li>
          <li>Delivery delays caused by traffic, weather, security checks or other reasons beyond our reasonable control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">3. Customer Unavailability</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are unreachable or unavailable at the time of delivery;</li>
          <li>If the address provided is incorrect or incomplete; or</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          the order may be marked as <strong>Delivered</strong>. In such cases,
          <strong>no refund, no free replacement, and no re-delivery</strong> will be provided due to the perishable nature of the items.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">4. Allergies, Health &amp; Dietary Preferences</h2>
        <p>
          It is your responsibility to review ingredients and ensure that the product is suitable for your dietary needs,
          medical conditions, allergies, religious or personal preferences. HealthySafar will not be liable for:

        <ul>
          <li>Adverse reactions due to undisclosed allergies or medical conditions;</li>
          <li>Issues arising from failure to read or understand product descriptions;</li>
          <li>Improper storage, handling or consumption after delivery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No refund will be issued on these grounds.</p>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-4">5. Wrong, Spoiled or Damaged Food – Limited Goodwill Remedy</h2>
        <p>In rare situations where:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>you must:</p>

          <li>Provide clear photo/video evidence of the packaging, product and order details.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </ul>
        <p>

          or a continuing obligation.
